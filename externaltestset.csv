"Hip Hop star Jay-Z has blasted traditional Christian values in an epic rant where he claims to be part of an exclusive club of ""smart people"" who worships ""our true lord; Satan.""The billionaire rapper has also claimed that ""God created Lucifer to be the bearer of truth and light,"" and that ""Jesus never existed"" but was merely a ""tool created by smart people to control dumb people.""During a backstage tirade at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans on Friday, Jay-Z pointed around the room saying, ""ya'll being played.""
""There ain't no Jesus.""Ya'll slaves to a fake religion.""Do you think I got where I am praying to a guy that don't exist?""No. I found the guys who invented that guy and I joined the club.""Then I worked my way to the top.""I earned my new form of humanity and The music star claims that Satanism became the ""highest form of being"" due to the ease of manipulating ""mentally-challenged Christians"" who ""desire to be slaves.""He stated that ""there's real spirituality and guidance in the Church of Satan,"" that rewards its followers with ""wealth and success,"" but ""Christians have prayed to God for years and ain't gotten nothing back, just silence and emptiness."" This, apparently, is what caused Satan to have ""gotten a bad rap"" from Christians who worship a ""fake religion, built by assholes.""Pointing to a small crowd of backstage ticket winners, the multi-Grammy Award-winning musician said:
""How many of ya'll have gotten rich, or famous, after you prayed to God?""Come on, raise your hands?""
As the young fans began to murmur nervously, Jay-Z announced: 
""I can answer for y’all because I am free.""I answer to a higher power.""None of you are rich and none of you are famous because no one is listening to your prayers.""I got everything I wanted because I surrendered to our true lord, Satan.""Because I recognized Jesus is the original fake news, designed to enslave humanity.""""God created Lucifer, not Jesus, so he could rule over us as Satan.""I’m telling you this because I know you guys look up to me and want to emulate me.""I will give you this one guarantee, if you start following the doctrine of Lucifer, you will taste success.""The secret of the universe opens up to you. ""It is immediate and glorious.""
The 99 Problems rapper also promoted his Satanic beliefs onstage, telling the audience they should ignore the rules of the venue and the security staff trying to enforce them.Jay-Z instructed his fans to ""Do what thou wilt"" instead of respecting the rules.maturity when I fully embraced my older brother, Satan."" It's no secret Jay-Z is a longtime follower of the English occultist founder of the Satanic religion Thelema, Aleister Crowley. The religion is based on the idea that the beginning of the Aeon of Horus was marked by the start of the 20th century, in which a new ethical code would be adhered to:
""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.""
This statement indicates that followers, known as Thelemites, should seek out their true path in life, and follow their ""True Will.""Jay-Z’s Satanic preaching is just the latest in a long line of public glimpses into the dark side that the rapper has shared.He recreated his image as a dark lord, after starting his career as an aspirational rapper, flashing Illuminati hand gestures and promoting Satanic symbolism as he rose to the top of the music industry.Jay-Z has since attempted to tone down his dark image since establishing himself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer. However, this latest disturbing rant in New Orleans suggests he has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society, far deeper than ever before.The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati has moved onto the next phase of the master plan, and has begun openly promoting sinister spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.Perhaps those most influenced by Jay-Z's Satanic promotions are his legions of disenfranchised youths, who aspire to one day lead a lifestyle like their hero."
